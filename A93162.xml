            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What if only to Phylozophiſe were to contemplate the ſmall Ideas of nature, then this high endeavour of love, is the great work of Phyloſophy, though he who loves but what he knows, changeth his Philoſophy into Logicks ſcientifical demonſtration, and I truely think one may be ſatisfied, as ſoon with a bare Skeleton of ſyllogiſmes bones As be filled with the notion of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious beauty, nothing, Nothing.

               <p>Some have thought this Love which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth men from bruits ſhould turn men into bruits. A pretty <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> indeed! Sure <hi>Ovid</hi> was of a better temper, then to libell againſt that Saint he much adored, to think ſo as a Stoicks barbarity whoſe unpeſſionate ſoul is but the dirty excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſtone. Can humane Love ſhrink
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:123657:78"/>into the black Rayes of an inhumane Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy? Forbid it <hi>Jove.</hi> They meerly dream and therefore fancy ſuch infelicity, for dreams are the fancies of men aſleep, and fancies are the dreams of men awake. No, No, None can love too much, when none can love enough, for although its Rayes are diſplayed to ſome in a greater Meridian as <hi>Phoebus</hi> his beams by a peculiar influence inaureates the Rodian Kingdomes, yet in caſe there is no fear of a beautifying condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for ſome in the very hot Sphere of their imbred deſires can live untouched like the Cold <hi>Salamander</hi> in her houſe of fire. And in other ſome love is the aſſiſtant form as thoſe Ethnick Phyloſophers aſcribed an Intelligence to the Heavens, and ſince the old Pagans would attribute no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion of life unto love, it muſt have a Rationall body wherein the vitall ſpirits might live <hi>Poſthumus,</hi> as a ſhade circumludeth <hi>Apollo's</hi> luſtres.</p>
               <p>Yet perhaps in ſpight of <hi>Cupid</hi> you ſcorn to love, well, ſay it were ſo, that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Lad-ſhip could not ſtrike ſparkes from
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:123657:79"/>that flinty Reſolution. The very Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick brow of a ſtately Lady would fire that ſnowy chilneſſe to an amorous heat. Her winning affections would invite your Appetite, as an Orator's ſwelling metaphors to feed upon fancies, the ſtarry Splendan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a Radiant eye (where the little boy ſits enſhrined, darting his flamy ſhafts) would force your Captive Genious to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces. And yet how often in catching at her beauty (the fair ſhade of her body) ſhall you be deluded like birds who pecked at the tempting allurements of <hi>Zeuxis</hi> his Painted grapes, how oft ſhall you freeze in hot embers of the torrid Zone. How oft melt in heat under the cold blaſts of the frigid Orb, ſo that as <hi>Agrippa</hi> bought the Roman Empire for Tyrant <hi>Nero</hi> with the Prize of her own life. <hi>Occidat modo imperet</hi>— You would deſire to be laid on the funerall Pyre ſuppoſe thoſe perfumed flames would waſt your ſecond reſurrection to her <hi>Elizium.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Cupids</hi> Revengements indeed, yet to be excuſed, for he follows the judgment of his eyes, more then his mind,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:123657:79"/>and therefore falls into it by a blind igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. For my Part, I would croud into the hot ſparkes of a Lady's eye, in ambition to ſcorch my wings with the proud flye. For my part, I would verdure like the Purple Roſes on her Crimſon cheeks, Say, <hi>May</hi> leavs were dulled by thoſe eye-lightning beams.</p>
